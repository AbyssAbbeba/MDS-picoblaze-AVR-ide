\section{Short introduction}



\section{Main simulation panel}
    This panel is the main part of the simulator user interface. Simulator simulates instruction set of PicoBlaze family and his copies.
    Following picture shows main window of the simulator. You can find here internal registers, scratchpad ram, input and output ports, stack,
    program counter, elapsed time and cycles, actual clock and internal flags: CARRY and ZERO. All those features can be edited during
    processor simulation.
    \begin{description}
     \item [Register field] You can find here values of internal processor registers. First column represents name, second value in decimal, third
     hexadecimal and last binary.
     \item [Scratch-pad RAM] This hex editor represents values stored in scratch-pad RAM. Address of particular field is adition of line number
     and column number. 
    \end{description}

\section{Modes of simulation}
    There are 4 modes of simulation:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item STEP: Execute exactly one intruction, no matter how many machine cycles it will take. This does not apply for macro-instruction, in that case each instruction of the macro is executed separately.
        \item ANIMATE: Do the same as step, but in a loop, one after another until stopped by a waring condition or user request.
        \item RUN: This is generally the same as animate, but much faster, because GUI is not updated so often as in the animate mode.
        \item RESET: Resets everything to the initial state of program.
        \item UNHIGHLIGHT: Cleans up all highlighted text.

%         \item STEP OVER: Execute as many instructions as possible until simulator cursor changes its location from one line of source code to another.
        \item ANIMATE: Do the same as step, but in a loop, one after another until stopped by a waring condition or user request.
        \item RUN: This is generally the same as animate, but much faster, because GUI is not updated so often as in the animate mode.
%         \item STEP BACK: Take back the last performed step. There is limited number of step which can be taken back.

    \end{itemize}
