    \subsection{Left and right panel}
        \begin{table}[h!]
            \centering
            \begin{tabular}{cc}
                \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img/left_panel.png}
                    &
                \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img/right_panel.png}
                    \\
                Left panel & Right panel
            \end{tabular}
        \end{table}

        \subsubsection{Left panel}
            \index{Left panel}
            Left panel displays files in your project tree. Also it allows to perform various actions via context menus (right click), like: configure project, close project, open file, close file, remove file from this list, or set some file as the project's main source file, etc.

        \subsubsection{Right panel}
            \index{Right panel}
            Right panel contains lists of breakpoints, bookmarks, and macros defined in your source code. From these lists you can easily navigate to the corresponding line in your source code just by clicking on an item. List of macros might sometimes need to refresh which can be achieved by [Right~Click] -> [Refresh].

            \begin{table}[h!]
                \begin{tabular}{ccc}
                    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img/listbookmarks.png}
                        &
                    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img/listbreakpoints.png}
                        &
                    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{img/listmacros.png}
                    \\ Bookmarks & Breakpoints & Macros
                \end{tabular}
            \end{table}

    \subsection{Central panel}
        Central panel contains the main text editor with syntax highlight for writing a source code. In the editor you can also easily add breakpoints and bookmarks just by clicking on desired line number by left or right mouse button, each invokes different action.

    \subsection{Top panel}
        \index{Toolbar}
        Top panel contains main menu and the toolbar, both can be used to invoke various actions which are described alter in this documentation.

        \begin{figure}[h!]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{img/top_panel.png}
            \caption{Top panel}
        \end{figure}

    \subsection{Bottom panel}
        Bottom panel consists of simulator main panel and compiler messages.

        In simulator main panel you can see status of internal registers, scratch-pad ram, input and output ports, call
        stack, program counter, elapsed time, elapsed machine cycles, processor clock, and internal flags: carry, zero, interrupt, and interrupt enable. Most of these values can be edited during processor simulation.

        In compiler messages panel you can see textual output from the assembler, like warnings and other messages.

        \begin{figure}[h!]

    \subsection{Exit \& Restoration}
        \subsubsection{Session Restoration}
            When the main window is closed on user request, the MDS automatically saves the current session and restores it when run again. The session includes list of opened projects. When you run MDS, the projects and their files from the last session are automatically reopened as they were last time when you closed the MDS window.

        \subsubsection{Exit Dialog}
            \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0pt}
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=130pt]{img/exit_dialog.png}
                \caption{Exit Dialog}
            \end{wrapfigure}

            When closing the main window, MDS automatically checks if all files which you have been working on have been saved on the disk; and if some of them have not, it displays a dialog (Exit Dialog) asking you which files you want to save and which not. But be aware that this function cannot possibly handle (unlikely) possibility of program crash, we recommend that you save your files regularly to prevent accidental data loss.

            \begin{description}
                \item[Button Save:] Saves the selected file; and if there is only one file left, exits the IDE.
                \item[Button Save All:] Saves all files and exits the IDE.
                \item[Button Discard:] Discards recent changes in the selected file; if there is only one file left, exits the IDE.
                \item[Button Discard All:] Discards recent changes in all files and exits the IDE.
                \item[Button Cancel:] Closes the dialog and returns to the IDE, the main window will remain opened.

\section{Code Editor}
    \index{Code editor}
    Code editor is optimized for writing source code for your applications, it behaves as is generally expected from a code editor. The editor has two different modes of operations:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Editing mode: for editing your files, this mode is for reading and writing/editing.
        \item Simulation mode: for displaying progress of the program simulation, in this mode the displayed code is for reading only.
    \end{enumerate}

    \subsection{Main features}
        \subsubsection{Syntax highlight}
            Syntax highlight is supported only for the PicoBlaze assembly language. Syntax highlighting is automatically activated for files with extension \texttt{.asm} and \texttt{.psm}, otherwise syntax highlight stays inactive.

        \subsubsection{Left panel}
            For easier navigation, the editor's left panel shows line numbers in your code, bookmarks, and breakpoints.

        \subsubsection{Editor status bar}
            Editor status bar displays information about current column and line number.

        \subsubsection{Context menu}
            Context menu pops-up when you right click in the editor or when you press the Menu key (available on some keyboards), it provides means to perform some basic operations like Cut, Copy, Paste, etc.

        For efficient debugging, our simulator supports breakpoints. Breakpoint is a mark associated with certain location in the program code; when reached, it triggers a temporarily halt in the running simulation. You can use breakpoints to test and debug programs in a manner that the program can be examined in stages delimited by breakpoints. Please be also aware that using breakpoints slows down the simulator (about by 30\% in run mode); if you want to reach the maximum simulation speed, you may temporarily disable (switch off) breakpoints generally in [Main~Menu]~-> [Simulation]~-> [Disable~Breakpoints].

        Another feature is bookmarks; when editing one location in your source code more often, it may be useful to add a bookmark to it so you can quickly get back when you need. Like breakpoints bookmarks are marks in your source code but they are meant solely for quick navigation, they do not affect simulation or compilation in any way.

\section{Project management}
    \index{Project management}
    MDS can organize your files into groups called projects, a project is also bound with its specific configuration which includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Information about which exact processor do you use and in what exact configuration (memory size, etc.).
        \item Compiler settings to be applied: paths to search for included file, which file formats you want to be generated by the assembler, what VHDL template you want to use, etc.
        \item Whether your project comprises of a set of independent files, or if it has one main file and other project files are only included in it using the \texttt{INCLUDE} directive.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{Untracked files}
        \index{Untracked files}
        Besides files bound with particular project, you can also open, modify, save, compile, and simulate on files which are not part of your current MDS project. These files, files not bound with a project, we call untracked files, using untracked files has some limitations and under normal circumstances it should be avoided, for instance when you run simulator on an untracked file, note that in that case compiler has to be run first, MDS does not know what processor it should use as target, what is the size of its program memory, whether to generate MEM file or not, etc. All these configuration options can be set for also untracked files but these settings are ultimately lost when you leave the MDS environment, while if you used project, they would be saved. The purpose of project is to provide you better comfort while using this IDE, although in some cases you just do not want to bother with creating a new project just for one file for a few minutes of work, and that is where the untracked files comes handy.
