This week:
- add Project actions (Save project - done, Close project)
- add compiler support (Make done, output done, generate makefile, choice between Make and simple sdcc)
- fix minor bugs (file not found, moving widgets with "Open/New project")

- hex editor (part done)

Future goals:
- plugin manager (class implementation, dialog implementation)
- gui template based on project setting
- interface config
- project config
- simulation
- upload to HW
- Code editor (highlight, source managment - class viewer etc.)
