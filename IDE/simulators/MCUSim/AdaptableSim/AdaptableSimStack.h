/**
 * @brief
 * C++ Interface: AdaptableSim simulator subsystem for stack.
 *
 * Implements processor stack, requires no configuration, default stack size is 31, the stack in initialized to contain
 * only zeros after MCU reset. Fast operation of the subsystem was a priority. The stack subsystem simulator shares the
 * common memory interface, like register file, scratch pad RAM, program memory, etc.
