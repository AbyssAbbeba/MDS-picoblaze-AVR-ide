//!
//! @section install Description
//! This embedded application code illustrates how to implement a USB application
//! with the ATMega32U4 controller using the generic HID class implementation.
//!
//! A pc side applications allow to communicate with the embedded firmware (see \ref UsbHidGenericDemos).
//!
//! This sample application can be configured for both STK600 or EVK527 hardware, see #TARGET_BOARD
//! define value in config.h file.
//!
//! @section arch Architecture
//! As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the main.c file.
//! The main function first performs the initialization of a scheduler module and then runs it in an infinite loop.
//! The scheduler is a simple infinite loop calling all its tasks defined in the conf_scheduler.h file.
//! No real time schedule is performed, when a task ends, the scheduler calls the next task defined in
//! the configuration file (conf_scheduler.h).
//!
//! The sample usb application is based on two different tasks:
//! - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level
//! enumeration process in device mode.
//! Once this task has detected that the usb connection is fully operationnal, it updates different status flags
//! that can be check within the high level application tasks.
//! - The hid task performs the high level device application operation.
//! Once the device is fully enumerated (DEVICE SETUP_SET_CONFIGURATION request received), the task
//! checks for received data on its OUT endpoint and transmit  data on its IN endpoint.
